Fork of JCarouselLite 1.0.1 that includes several improvements we needed for a project.

JCarouselLite Fluid improves upon JCarouselLite 1.0.1 with these changes:

  * Supports fluid-width objects (eg. 100% window width)
  * Code detects when browser is resized or mobile-browser orientation changes and reinitializes

Current known issues:
  * Only designed for horizontal scrolling
  * Only designed for 1 item being visible at a time
